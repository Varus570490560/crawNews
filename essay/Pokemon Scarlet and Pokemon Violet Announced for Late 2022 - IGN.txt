The Pokemon Company has announced that Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, a brand new open world Pokemon adventure, will be released on Nintendo Switch in late 2022.

Announced During Pokemon Day 2022's Pokemon Presents, these two new Game Freak-developed games will feature a new region and its three new Gen 9 starter Pokemon have already been revealed. At the beginning of the game, Trainers will need to choose between the Grass Cat Sprigatito, the Fire Croc Fuecoco, or the Water Duckling Quaxly.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are an "evolutionary" step for the Pokemon franchise and feature an "open world where various towns with no borders blend seamlessly into the wilderness." The Pokemon Company also notes that "Pokemon can be seen everywhere in this wide-open world - in the skies, in the sea, and on the streets." 
While we obviously don't all the differences between the two versions, it has been revealed that Trainers will "have a different outfit depending on which game they are playing."
Sprigatito the Grass Cat has the Overgrow ability and its description says they are "capricious" and "attention-seeking." Fuecoco the Fire Croc has the Blaze ability and is "laid-back" and "does things at its own pace." Quaxly the Water Duckling has the Torrent ability and is "earnest and tidy." Though those are the only new Pokemon revealed so far, we've determined 50 Pokemon confirmed for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet from the trailer and screenshots.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet were only one of the many announcements during the Pokemon Presents showcase. To hear about all the others, including Pokemon Legends: Arceus' Daybreak update, check out our roundup of the Pokemon Day 2022 celebration
